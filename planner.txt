*** songs belong to one artist and many billboards
*** billboards has many notes

songs <--> billboards (many to many)
artist --> song (one to many)



### route nesting ###

root "pages#home"

get "billboards/:id/songs" => "songs#billboard_index"


get "billboards/:id/songs/:id" => "songs#billboard_show" (can render the artist show page)

resources :artist do 
    resources :songs
end

resources :billboards




Question: How do I connect my songs to artists and billboards?
    First: create a song via artist nested route
    Second: send back a list of billboards with links to a billboard/:id/songs/new route?
                                                           
Artist Routes
    artist/:id/song/:id
    FROM THE SHOW ROUTE:
        Make a checkbox hack that will display/remove a form which can be used to select billboards from a list of all billboards via checkboxes.

Billboard Routes
    billboards/:id/edit
    FROM THE BILLBOARD EDIT/NEW ROUTE
        we can make a form of checkboxes from a list of all songs, the same as the list of billboards in the songs show route.
